We can use the binary search instead since we now have a sorted array. We can implement it as a recursive divide and conquer algorithm. We begin with the element in the middle. If the search query element is greater than the middle element, we begin the search again on the right half of the array. If the search query element is less than the middle element, we begin the search again on the left half of the array. This repeats until at some point we either find the element or we do not.
